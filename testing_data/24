原唱︰Glenn MedeirosIf I had to live my life without you near meThe days would all be emptyThe nights would seem so longWith you I see forever oh so clearlyI might have been in love beforeBut it never felt this strongOur dreams are young and we both knowThey'll take us where we want to goHold me now, touch me nowI don't want to live without youNothing's gonna change my love for youYou oughta know by now how much I love youOne thing you can be sure ofI'll never ask for more than your loveNothing's gonna change my love for youYou oughta know by now how much I love youThe world may change my whole life throughBut nothing's gonna change my love for youIf the road ahead is not so easy轉載來自 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 Our love will lead a way for usLike a guiding starI'll be there for you if you should need meYou don't have to change a thingI love you just the way you areSo come with me and share the viewI'll help you see forever tooHold me now, touch me nowI don't want to live without youNothing's gonna change my love for youYou oughta know by now how much I love youOne thing you can be sure ofI'll never ask for more than your loveNothing's gonna change my love for youYou oughta know by now how much I love youThe world may change my whole life throughBut nothing's gonna change my love for you
